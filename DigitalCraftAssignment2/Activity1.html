      <h2>The Curse of the Current Reviews</h2>
      <p>
        When you want to buy any application from the Apple iTunes store you
        have more choices than you can handle. Most of the users scroll past the
        application description completely avoiding it like ads displayed on the
        right column of your webpage. Their choice is dependent on three
        important factors price, screenshot and reviews.
